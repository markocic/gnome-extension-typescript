# My extension
This is a template repository to quickly get started with creating a GNOME extension using TypeScript. \
\
All files were created according to this [gjs.guide page](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/typescript.html). Additionally, I included `.gitignore` and a GPLv3 license. I encourage you to read the page if this your first time creating a GNOME extension using TypeScript.
